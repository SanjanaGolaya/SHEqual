**Problem Statement: Graph for a Better World - Creating STEM opportunities for women

**Description

As the name plays at, this project aims at creating equal STEM opportunities for women. The vision is to increase the percentage of women in STEM workforces by bridging the gap between women and opportunities that are a correct fit for them. As of now the features provided in this tool are:

Getting job recommendations according to your skill set
Getting information on job postings in your area
Checking for eligibility by matching your work experience against the work experience required for the job posting
Matching you with women of similar interests
Getting insights from data about most popular jobs, highest-paying jobs, most in-demand skills

**Impactfulness** - This project impacts all women who have dreams to learn and grow in STEM fields. Once fully functional, it'll be a one-stop solution for women to get in touch with not just budding opportunities, but also other women who have similar interests as them. In terms of numbers, women account for 49.6% of the world population, so we have a large audience to make a difference to. I hope someday, I can impact the life/career of another woman like me, interested in working in Tech.

**Innovativeness** - This tool uses Graph Databases for the first time to create a web application to cater to multiple aspects of STEM opportunities. As of now, a similar site exists for Australian women, but my goal is to create a global community and use cutting-edge technology to benefit them.

**Ambitiousness** - This project is extremely ambitious as it takes into account multiple dimensions - Jobs, events, community members, courses etc. In the future, it will have many more aspects to it and the graph will be scaled to more than double it's size. Vertex and edge counts will be in millions.

**Applicability** - Once deployed, the web application should be similar to that like LinkedIn, just personally tailored to women, and with added functionalities. Women can sign up/register with their details, and they will be given notifications about available jobs, courses, events, check for eligibility for those jobs, and more.

## Dependencies:

!pip install -U pyTigerGraph

!pip install iso3166

## Installation:

This project simply needs Python on local system to run. Alternatively, the Data Analysis and Visualization notebook can be run on Google colab. Front-end work can be viewed by running the index.html file on Visual Studio Code

## Known Errors and Potential improvements 
SHEQUAL has a very long way to go ahead. In the future, I hope to incorporate a personalized chatbot assistant that helps the user with personalized recommendations, and will use the ML workbench for this. SHEqual will also have a notification feature and a messaging feature with which you can directly message fellow members of the community. The tool will also bring into the picture events happening near your location that match your interests. Lastly, a tonne of work is left on both the backend and frontend, and a real time connection to the DB is yet to be established.
